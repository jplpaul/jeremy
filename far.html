       <h1>FAR CRY 5</h1>
      <p>Far Cry 5 is an action-adventure first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It is an entry in the Far Cry series, and was released on March 27, 2018.The game takes place in the fictional Hope County, Montana, where charismatic preacher Joseph Seed and his cult The Project at Eden's Gate holds a dictatorial rule over the area. The story follows an unnamed Junior Deputy, who becomes trapped with their task force in Hope County and works alongside factions of a Resistance to liberate the county from Eden's Gate.Creative director Dan Hay described the design of the open world as being modeled on the outposts from previous titles in the Far Cry series. These outposts represented a small section of the map occupied by enemy forces and the player was tasked with liberating them by killing or neutralizing the enemy presence. The outposts were designed with multiple approaches for the player to take and it was this element that the development team tried to recreate in the wider game world of Far Cry 5. The player is dropped into the game world with little context, direction or objective markers and is instead required to navigate the world on their own. Hay expressed a desire to create what he termed the "anecdote factory", a game where two players could venture out from the same point in opposite directions and have completely different experiences that they would then share with one another anecdotally.</p>
